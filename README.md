# John Braybrooke's Personal Site

A minimal personal website built with pure HTML and CSS. No frameworks, no tracking, just clean code and soft blue.

## About This Project

This site is a collaborative effort between John and Claude. It's a space where creativity and ideas flow both ways - feel free to be creative, suggest improvements, and bring your own ideas to the table. This is as much about the process as it is about the result.

## Features

- Clean, minimalist design
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Hand-crafted pixel art creatures hiding throughout the site (created by Claude)
- No JavaScript (except analytics)
- No build process - just open the HTML files

## Pixel Art Creatures

The site features small pixel art creatures tucked into various corners:
- **Owl** - Perched in the navigation corner (blinks on hover)
- **Blob** - Curious friend near section headers (wiggles on hover)
- **Dragon** - Guards the post boxes (bounces on hover)
- **Cat** - Sleeping in the footer credits

All pixel art created using pure CSS with the box-shadow technique.
